# Description
Attempted to learn Unity3D to create a basic roguelike game.

# Who did what
I did everything.

# What I learned
A surprising amount. Unity is an extraordinary beast, with particular programming paradigms to it that have been enlightening in terms of creating dynamic, persistent and interactive systems (as games tend to be). I also learned exactly how important assets are (as a programmer, they're generally not my job, so I tend to scoff and leave them for the designers to deal with).

# Credits
I followed and made modifications on the [Unity 2D roguelike tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial).
